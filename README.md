For task one, I implemented a function that helped 
to take an array of numbers as an argument. 
I used an example to show the functionality of my code.
My code returned a new array where each even number was squared
and my odd numbers were tripled.

For task two, I created a function that took two arrays
as arguments. I used an example to showcase the functionality of my code.
Each element in my string array had a corresponding number in my number array.
I made elements of the string that corresponded to an even number capitalized
and the ones that corresponded to odd numbers, I left in lowercase.

For task three, I exported my formatArrayStrings function from arrayManipulation file.
The imported function repeated the same action from Task two, where names corresponding to even
numbers are capitalized and names corresponding to odd numbers, remain in lowercase. I then implemented
a test to show the functionality of my code. My code returns an array of the objects, with auto-increment.
